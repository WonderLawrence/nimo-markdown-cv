## Work & Project Experience

### **Tencent Games, Timi J3 Studio** `July 2020 -`

_FPS Mobile Game Based On Famous IP_<br>
In order to anthropomorphize the AI obstacle avoidance behavior, Independently implement the ORCA algorithm plugin for obstacle avoidance instead of using the engine slolution of simple RVO algorithm. As a result, we avoid the risk of AI moving out of navmesh boundary, and also solve the first-person perspective shaking problem originated in UE4 RVO algorithm. On the other hand, We also optimize the multi AI avoidance behavior in corner terrain with this plugin. <br>

Responsible for the development of AI shooting and skill using behavior, design and implement the throwing skill using framework, anthropomorphize the AI corner terrain throwing skill.<br>

### **Netease Games, Zen Studio** `July 2018 - July 2020`
