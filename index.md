## Work & Project Experience

### **Tencent Games, Timi J3 Studio** `July 2020 - Present`

_FPS Mobile Game Based On Famous IP_<br>
In order to anthropomorphize the AI obstacle avoidance behavior, independently implement the ORCA algorithm plugin for obstacle avoidance instead of using the engine slolution of simple RVO algorithm. As a result, we avoid the risk of AI moving out of navmesh boundary, and also solve the first-person perspective shaking problem which is originated in UE4 RVO algorithm. On the other hand, we also optimize the multi AI avoidance behavior in corner terrain with this plugin.<br>  
Responsible for the development of AI shooting and skill using behavior, design and implement the throwing skill framework for AI, anthropomorphize the throwing skill behavior of AI in corner terrain.<br>  
Implement a python development evevironment based on C++ message dispatcher framework. RPC framework based on python3.6 was also implemented on this project. This will contribute a lot to the team development efficiency.<br>

### **Netease Games, Zen Studio** `July 2018 - July 2020`

_harry potter magic awakened_<br>
Independently built the gameplay framewrok of dance system, card system and house cup system.<br>  
Participate in developing the login system, chat system, and anti-addiction system.<br>  
Several public lessons about CPython runtime framework with a lot of praise.<br>

_3v3 MOBA Intern Game Project_<br>
Served as the main engineer in this intern game project, helping the team to complete the server framework. Designed a framework for running behavior tree and implement A* algorithm for monster AI in the game. Completed the design of server and client rpc framework and the encryption and decryption algorithm of message packets. As a result, we achieved the 4th rank position among more than twenty teams.<br>

### **Freewheel** `Jun 2017 - Aug 2017`

_Intern Project_<br>
Optimize the worker server workflow process and reduce the I/O pressure on the database server. Design a multithreading task management & fixed start address memory allocator. Making the user's request reponse speed increased by 78%.<br>
